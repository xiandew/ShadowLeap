## Description
This is a single-player 2D pixel game made with `Slick2D` liabrary. Users can use the arrow keys on the keyboard to control the movement of the frog (player). The water and vehicles (except the bulldozer which will push the player away) are considered to be harmful, which will cause the player lose one life (see the left bottom corner) if touching them. The game consists of two levels and the goal is to reach all the holes on the opposite side alive.

## Play around
It is not acccessible through browser so one way to experience it is to download the files and run it locally though IDE (eg. Eclipse).
